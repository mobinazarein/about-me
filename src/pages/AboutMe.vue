<h2 class="mb-3 ">▎About Me</h2>
      Hello! I am Mobina, a passionate front-end developer dedicated to creating exceptional user experiences. In

      <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">▎Skills and Expertise</h2>

      My expertise encompasses a range of modern technologies and tools that enable me to build beautiful and
      user-friendly websites. I am proficient in HTML and CSS, allowing me to implement the structure and design of
      websites professionally. Additionally, by utilizing JavaScript, I add dynamic and engaging interactions to web
      pages that enhance user experience.

      Furthermore, I have experience working with modern frameworks like Vue.js and Nuxt.js. With Vue.js, I can create
      scalable and interactive web applications, and with Nuxt.js, I can easily build server-side rendered (SSR)
      applications that significantly improve page loading speed. These techniques help me create websites that are not
      only visually appealing but also fast and optimized.
